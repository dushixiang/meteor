# Meteor
[English](README.md)  ï½œ  [ä¸­æ–‡](README_zh.md)
## Introduction
Meteor is a transport layer proxy tool with basic functionalities such as port forwarding, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy, etc.
Beyond these basic features, Meteor focuses more on usability and network security, with optimizations and improvements. 
For example, it offers persistent process services, and access rules can be set based on GeoIP for enhanced security. 
Future updates will include additional security features such as threat intelligence integration, rate limiting, unified log integration, etc.

Our Goal:
To create a simple-to-use, default-secure network proxy tool.

## Usage

**Installation**
```shell
meteor install
```

**Modify the Configuration File**

```shell
vim /etc/meteor/meteor.yaml
```

Configuration file exampleï¼š
```shell
location:
  type: geoip                 # Currently only supports GeoIP
  file: GeoLite2-City.mmdb    # After configuring GeoIP, rules can be set based on cities. The database file needs to be downloaded and the file path specified in the configuration.
forwarders:
  - protocol: tcp             # Only supports tcp and udp
    addr: ":54321"            # Local listening address
    to: 127.0.0.1:12345       # Target address
    rules:
      - city: beijing,chengdu  # City, supports Chinese and Pinyin
        allowed: true         # Allow access âœ…
      - ip: 0.0.0.0/0         # 0.0.0.0/0 represents all IP addresses
        allowed: false        # This configuration means only allow access from IP addresses in Beijing and Chengdu, all others are denied. ðŸˆ²
  - protocol: udp
    addr: ":54321"
    to: 127.0.0.1:12345
proxies:
  - protocol: http           # Only supports http, https, socks5
    addr: 127.0.0.1:80       # Local listening address
    auth: true               # Enable authentication
    accounts:                # Account list
      - username: a          # Username
        password: b          # Password
  - protocol: https
    addr: 127.0.0.1:443   
    key: /root/key.pem       # HTTPS key path
    cert: /root/cert.pem     # HTTPS cert path
    auth: true               # Enable authentication
    accounts:                # Account list
      - username: a          # Username
        password: b          # Password
  - protocol: socks5
    addr: 127.0.0.1:1080
    auth: true               # Enable authentication
    accounts:                # Account list
      - username: a          # Username
        password: b          # Password
```

Start
```shell
meteor start
```

Stop
```shell
meteor stop
```

Uninstall
```shell
meteor uninstall
```

## Other Parameters

`meteor -h`

```shell
